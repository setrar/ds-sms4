SMS4 is a 32-round block cipher with a 128-bit block size and a 128-bit user key.

SMS4 algorithm is used in the Chinese National Standard for Wireless LAN WAPI [1]. Although WAPI was rejected In March 2006 by ISO (International Organization for Standardization), however, WAPI continues to be used in the Chinese WLAN industry. Many international corporations, such as SONY, support WAPI in relevant products. SMS4 is a block cipher that produces a 128 bit output from a 128 bit input under the control of a 128 bit key [2].
