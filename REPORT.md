# &#x1F4DD; REPORT


The project accounts for 50% of the final grade.
All members of the group will get the same grade.
It will be evaluated based on your source code and your report which you will write in markdown format in the /REPORT.md file.
Do not neglect the report, it will have a significant weight.
Keep it short but complete:

Provide block diagrams with a clear identification of the registers and of the combinatorial parts; name the registers, explain what the combinatorial parts do.
Provide state diagrams and detailed explanations for your state machines.
Explain what each VHDL source file contains and what its role is in the global picture.
Detail and motivate your design choices (partitioning, scheduling of operations...)
Explain how you validated each part.
Comment your synthesis results (maximum clock frequency, resource usage...)
Provide an overview of the performance of your cryptographic accelerator (e.g., in Mb/s).
Document the companion software components you developed (drivers, scripts, libraries...)
Provide a user documentation showing how to use your cryptographic accelerator and its companion software components.
...

The deadline for the submission of source codes and report is the day before the written exam at 23:59.
It is a sharp deadline after which the repository will become read-only and there will be no way to modify anything any more.
Your source codes and your report must be pushed before the deadline in a branch named final of your project's git repository.
Please check twice that you did not forget anything in another branch, the final branch is the only branch that will be considered.
