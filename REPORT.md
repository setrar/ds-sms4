# &#x1F4DD; REPORT


The project accounts for 50% of the final grade.
All members of the group will get the same grade.
It will be evaluated based on your source code and your report which you will write in markdown format in the /REPORT.md file.
Do not neglect the report, it will have a significant weight.
Keep it short but complete:

##### **&#x1F516;** **(&#x61;)** ___Provide block diagrams___

- with a clear identification of the registers and of the combinatorial parts; 
- name the registers, 
- explain what the combinatorial parts do.

##### **&#x1F516;** **(&#x62;)** ___Provide state diagrams___ 

- detailed explanations for your state machines.

Explain what each VHDL source file contains and what its role is in the global picture.

Detail and motivate your design choices (partitioning, scheduling of operations...)

Explain how you validated each part.

Comment your synthesis results (maximum clock frequency, resource usage...)

Provide an overview of the performance of your cryptographic accelerator (e.g., in Mb/s).

Document the companion software components you developed (drivers, scripts, libraries...)

Provide a user documentation showing how to use your cryptographic accelerator and its companion software components.
...

the `final` branch is the only branch that will be considered.
